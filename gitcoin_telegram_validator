Hey there folks! 

We are looking for someone to help code up a really simple telegram tool. You could even use something like IFTTT or Zapier. 

This is what it must do:

As soon as a new user joins a telegram channel (it will be a channel that I/we are an admin on, it adds the telegram handle
to a google sheets page and time stamps it. 

Additionally, it needs to track who invited who to the telegram channel. I'm not sure the best way to do this but essentially we are trying 
to audit a referral system. If Johnny invites Jane to the channel Johnny should get a point next to his telegram handle. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
